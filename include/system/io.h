/* Default I/O accessor functions writeb() and readb().
 *
 * On memory-mapped I/O platforms, define CONFIG_MMIO and use the memory-
 * mapped address as your I/O address (IOPTR).  Then readb() and writeb()
 * will work for both the target platform, and for the simulator.
 *
 * On other platforms, you should test CONFIG_SIM in your platform header
 * and only call readb/writeb in simulation.  Then it is up to you to
 * decide how to do the I/O on a real target.  If you don't mind function
 * call overhead, you can also just set CONFIG_CALLIO and then define
 * your own implementation of readb/writeb to do the right thing.
