/* A "tick" is defined as the minimum unit of time that is
 * tracked by the kernel.  A tick represents some multiple of
 * the IRQ frequency, since the IRQ happens more often than
 * we need for timing granularity.
 *
 * We define this to be 16 now, which means that every 16 IRQs,
 * we increment our "tick counter" by 1.  The tick then
 * represents about 16.66ms of actual time.
 *
 * The tick count is stored in a single byte field of the
 * task structure, so it can store up to about 4 seconds.
 * If you need to sleep longer than this, use 'task_sleep_sec'
 * instead of 'task_sleep'.
